AB The significance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the
   respiratory tract of 9 cystic fibrosis patients have been studied
   by means of immunoelectrophoretical analysis of patients' sera for
   the number of precipitins against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the
   concentrations of 16 serum proteins.  In addition, the clinical and
   radiographical status of the lungs have been evaluated using 2
   scoring systems.  Precipitins against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were
   demonstrated in all sera, the maximum number in one serum was 22.
   The concentrations of 12 of the serum proteins were significantly
   changed compared with matched control persons.  Notably IgG and IgA
   were elevated and the "acute phase proteins" were changed, the
   latter suggesting active tissue damage.  The concentrations of 3 of
   the acute phase proteins, notably haptoglobin, were correlated to
   the number of precipitins suggesting that the respiratory tract
   infection in patients with many precipitins is accompanied by more
   tissue damage than the infection in patients with few precipitins.
   The results indicate no protective value of the many precipitins on
   the tissue of the respiratory tract.

AB Salivary amylase levels were determined in normal subjects from
   birth until adult life and in children with conditions sometimes
   associated with low pancreatic amylase such as malnutrition, coeliac
   disease and cystic fibrosis.  Mixed saliva was collected under
   carefully standardised conditions and amylase was measured by the
   method of Dahlqvist.  There was a wide scatter of values in the 84
   normal subjects, but concentrations rose from very low levels at
   birth to reach adult levels by the age of 6 months to 1 year.
   Salivary amylase activity rose normally over ten weeks in one
   premature infant fed milk by gastrostomy.  Thirteen children with
   coeliac disease and 9 children with cystic fibrosis mostly had
   normal salivary amylase concentrations.  Six out of 12 malnourished
   children with jejunal villous atrophy of uncertain aetiology had low
   levels which rose to normal as recovery began.

AB This article reports on the possibility of using instrumental
   neutron activation analysis (INAA) of sodium in nail clippings for
   diagnosing cystic fibrosis (CF) in children and adults, for
   detecting heterozygotes and for screening in the neonatal period.
   Nail clippings from 1322 newborns, 22 CF patients (two of them
   newborns), 52 healthy controls and 22 heterozygotes were analyzed.
   The discrimination between CF patients and controls was found to be
   precise for individuals above one year of age and INAA of nail
   clippings should be accepted as a diagnostic test for CF after this
   age.  Heterozygotes could not be detected by the method.  During the
   first five days of life there is a big overlap between the values
   from normal newborns and those of CF children, which makes the
   method invaluable for early screening for CF.
